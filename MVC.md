## MVC in Express Applications

MVC stands for **Model-View-Controller**. It's a design pattern that separates an application's logic into three interconnected parts, promoting modularity and maintainability:

* **Model:** The Model represents your application's data and business logic. It interacts with the database, handles data validation, and encapsulates the rules and state of your application.

* **View:** The View is responsible for the visual representation of data. It usually involves templating engines (like EJS, Pug, etc.) to generate HTML that is sent to the user's browser.

* **Controller:** The Controller acts as a bridge between the Model and View. It handles incoming requests, processes data from the Model, and decides which View to render in response.

**How MVC Works in Express**

While Express doesn't strictly enforce MVC, it offers the flexibility to structure your application using this pattern:

* **Models:** You can define models using ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like Sequelize or Mongoose to interact with your database.
* **Views:** You'll use a templating engine and create view files to define the structure of your HTML responses. 
* **Controllers:** Express routes and their associated callback functions act as your controllers.

**Benefits of MVC in Express**

* **Separation of Concerns:** Decoupling data, display, and logic makes your code more organized and easier to maintain.
* **Testability:** Each component can be tested independently.
* **Reusability:** Models and views can often be reused in different parts of your application.
